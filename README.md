# Google Books Search
## Description
A web app where someone can signup and search for their favorite books. If signed-in you are able to save books to a list, and remove them if you decide you don't want it anymore, or if you decided that maybe it doesn't look as interesting as you initially thought.

## Installation
Go into the root folder of the repo and run `npm i` and it should install all of the dependencies for each package.json file!
## Usage
To use this website all you need to do is go to the deployed link https://damp-meadow-44450.herokuapp.com/. Once there you just need to hit the Sign up button and then create an account. Once an account has been created you can then save any books you might find interesting after searching up a keyword. You can then access all of your saved books through the Saved Books page, and if you decide that you don't really like a book anymore, or perhaps you ended up reading it, you can hit the remove book button and it will remove it from your saved books list! You can always come back later and log back in and you're list will still be there! You do not need to be logged in to search for books, however if you wish to save them you do need to be logged in.
